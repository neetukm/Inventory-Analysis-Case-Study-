## 📌 Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the inventory dataset. The dashboard provides insights into inventory performance by tracking key metrics such as purchase price, classification, vendor count, and brand distribution. It includes various dynamic visualizations, key performance indicators (KPIs), and interactive elements to explore relationships between different inventory attributes.

## 📊 Features

### 🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization

**Dynamic Visualizations**: Graphs and charts representing relationships between price, purchase price, classification, and vendor statistics.

**KPI Cards**: Displays key metrics such as total purchase price, average price, classification count, and vendor count.

**Trend Analysis**: Identify trends based on size, classification, and price variations.


### 🎛️ Interactivity & User Experience

**Slicers and Filters**: Users can filter data by price, invoice date, and classification to focus on specific segments.

**Hover Tooltips**: Provides additional details on data points when hovering over visualizations.

**Custom Theme & Styling**: Designed with professional colors to create an elegant and intuitive interface.

### 📈 Data Processing

**Python Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the raw dataset in a Jupyter Notebook.

**SQL Queries for Data Extraction**: Structured queries to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data efficiently.
